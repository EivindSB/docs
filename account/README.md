# Account

The account API enable you to perform operations on our account directly. This could be used to edit your account, add and remove Oauth clients.

Our dashboard is built on top of our account API so everything that is possible in the account API is possible via the API.

If you are a Idfy dealer you can use the API to create new accounts for your customers. Read more about Idfy dealers here: [dealers](../dealer.md).
