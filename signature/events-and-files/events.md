# Events

Tired of polling an API endpoint for results? 

The best way to retrieve signature events is by using our event API. Our event API support multiple event types \(webhoooks, .net rebus, polling\) and environments. An event will i be triggered if the signer clicks the sign url, the document is partially signed, document is signed, document is cancelled +++.

### Check out the events API documentation: [Events](/events/README.md)
