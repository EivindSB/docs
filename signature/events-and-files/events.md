# Events

Tired of polling for results?

Then use our event API to retrieve results on the fly with webhooks or our .net client. You can also poll this API to retrieve multiple events in one request, then mark them as resolved.

An event will i be triggered if the signer clicks the sign url, the document is partially signed, document is signed, document is cancelled +++.

### Check out the events API documentation: [Events](/events/README.md)
