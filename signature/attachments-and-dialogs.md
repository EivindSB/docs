# Attachments and dialogs

Some times you need the signer to sign multiple documents, or maybe just show them some attachments? That can be acheived!

You can also include dialogs specified for each signer with an info text.

Attachments is pdf files that can be signed, showed to or accepted by the signer

#### [Dialogs](/signature/attachments-and-dialogs/dialogs.md)

Dialogs contains information text the signer is shown/accepted before and/or after the signing
