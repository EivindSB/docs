###### Document tags

Why add document tags?

* You can query your documents with tags at a later time
* The tag is included in webhooks and events, this way it is easy to separate document events based on tags

###### Example \(Create document\)

```
{
    ...

    "Advanced": {
    "Tags": [
      "departement_2",
      "sales"
    ]

    ...

}
```
