# Events, redirect settings and files

This section contains all the info you need when you are deciding how the signature flow should be handled at your end.

* ### [Events](/events/README.md)

The easiest way to be kept up to date on what's happening with your customers signatures is using our events API

* ### [Redirect settings](/signature/events-and-files/redirect-settings.md)

Do you want the user to stay on your page during the signature? Or maybe be redirected back when done? Read more here
