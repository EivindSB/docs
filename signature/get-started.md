# Digital signatures quickstart

Securely collect digital signatures from your customers for your contracts and agreements, onboarding forms, declarations and more, using Nordic eIDs as mechanisms to sign with for your end users.

Step 1:

First, you need to establish a test account and API credentials. You can get a free API account in Idfy test environments by completing our onboarding form here: [https://onboard.idfy.io](https://onboard.idfy.io) and specifying that you want access to our signature services. You will then receive an e-mail with your API credentials, as well as some more information, test users and code examples.

Step 2:

When you have received your API credentials, you can use these to make calls towards the Idfy signature APIs. You can either make pure REST calls towards our APIs \(i.e. make your own HTTP client\), or use one of our pre-built SDKs in your preferred programming language. Check out our [SDKs](https://developer.idfy.io/sdk) and choose the SDK or approach that fits your needs best. One benefit of using an SDK is that you don't have to manage the API authentication and wrapping of HTTP calls yourself.

Step 3:

To get quickly started with testing the signature services, you can start using your preferred SDK and calling the appropriate methods within that given library, or you can for instance make some initial calls using cURL or the API tool Postman \(see more information and download Postman [here](https://www.getpostman.com/)\). For the sake of simplicity, we here show some initial calls using Postman.
