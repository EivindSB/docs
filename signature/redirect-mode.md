# Redirect settings

It's up to you how you want to use our application. On each signer you need to specify how you want him or her to be redirected.

### Request example

```
{
    ...
    "signers":    [{    
        ...
        "redirectSettings":    {
            "redirectMode": "donot_redirect"
        } 
        ...   
    ]
    ...
},    
```
