# Redirect settings

It's up to you how you want to use our application. On each signer you need to specify how you want him or her to be redirected.

### Request example

```
{
    ...
    "signers":    [{    
        ...
        "redirectSettings":    {
            "redirectMode": "donot_redirect"
        } 
        ...   
    ]
    ...
},
```

### A simple explanation of the different redirect modes

| Value | Explained | Depends on  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| donot\_redirect | The user will not leave our page during the signature process. | Nothing |
| redirect | The user will be redirected to the specified urls on error/abort/success. | error, cancel, success |
| iframe\_with\_webmessaging | You iframe our application and can use webmessaging to do what you want on success/error/abort. No redirect is executed. | domain |
| iframe\_with\_redirect | You iframe the application, with no use of webmessaging. The signer will be redirected to the specified urls | error, cancel, success |
| iframe\_with\_redirect\_and\_webmessaging | You get both redirect and webmessaging |  |



### Redirect guide

##### Step 1 - Create request

Be sure to include error, cancel and success urls in the redirectSettings object. The format should be a valid url with no special characters. If you have special characters be sure to url encode them.

```
{
    ...
    "signers":    [{    
        ...
        "redirectSettings":    {
            "redirectMode": "redirect",
            "success": "https://example.com/sign/success",
            "cancel": "https://example.com/sign/cancel",
            "error": "https://example.com/sign/error"
        } 
        ...   
    ]
    ...
},
```

##### Step 2 - Sign or cancel \(hopefully no error\)

Let the signer do what they want to do

##### Step 3 - Retrieve the redirect response

To make it easy for you the read some core data about the signature status we append a jwt token to the urls you defined. It will look like this: 

https://example.com/sign/success?idfy-jwt=\[jwt is inserted here\]

If you use this token you should parse and validate it as described in step 5.

##### Step 5 - Parse and validate the jwt \(optional\)

You can parse and validate the jwt here: [https://developer.idfy.io/api\#tag/Jwt](https://developer.idfy.io/api#tag/Jwt)

The response will look something like this, check the JwtValid and Expired properties to make sure the jwt is generated by us.

```
{
  "JwtValid": true,
  "Expired": false,
  "JwtPayload": {
    "AccountId": "efed4e57-cfb2-460b-bb8d-a6e200ac3688",
