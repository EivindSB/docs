# Norwegian BankID

The first Norwegian customers were issued a BankID in 2004. At that time, the Norwegian banking sector had been working for four years on developing a joint infrastructure. Today, 3.7 million Norwegians have a BankID, and more than 1.000,000 have BankID on mobile. BankID is used by all the country’s banks and public digital services and an increasing number of enterprises in a range of different sectors. It is an express goal for BankID Norway to stimulate increased use of BankID by enterprises outside the financial sector.

Electronic identification using BankID meets the official requirements that apply to identity verification and binding electronic signature. BankID is used by all the banks in Norway and can be used by all organisations and enterprises that are looking for secure and simple identification online.
