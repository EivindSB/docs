# Events, redirect settings and files

This section contains all the info you need when you are deciding how the signature flow should be handled at your end.

## [Events](../../notification/events/)

The easiest way to be kept up to date on what's happening with your customers signatures is by subscribing to events.

## [Files](files.md)

We keep the signed files for a limited time, it is up to you to store them. Read more about how you can do it here.

## [Redirect settings](redirect-settings.md)

Do you want the user to stay on your page during the signature process by embedding our solution in an iframe? Or maybe you want to redirect them back to your site when done?
