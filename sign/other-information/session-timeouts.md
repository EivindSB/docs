### Session timeouts

When a signer clicks on a link to sign a document they have a time limit to complete the operation.

The session will have a lifetime of 20 minutes if the signer is inactive, if the signer is active in the signature app however, the session token will be renewed with 20 new minutes. 



The token also has a maximum lifetime of \[x\] minutes regardless if the user is active or not.
