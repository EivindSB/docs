# Information

Our extra info APIs help you **gather information about persons and companies** in an efficient manner. We support data enrichment from many different data sources, both public and private.

Extra information can be used to enrich the data in for instance an onboarding process in combination with authentication or signatures, where you want to add more information like **address, phone number, credit ratings, AML/PEP lookups** and more.

Our extra info APIs can be used either standalone, or in combination with for instance forms APIs, authentication APIs or signing APIs, where extra data points can be requested in the same flow as an authentication or a signature.
