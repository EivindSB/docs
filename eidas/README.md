# eIDAS

eIDAS \(electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services\) is an EU regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. It is a set of standards for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Single Market. It was established in EU regulation № 910/2014 of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and repeals directive 1999/93/EC with effect from 30 June 2016.

The [Regulation \(EU\) N°910/2014](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG) on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market \(eIDAS Regulation\) adopted by the co-legislators on 23 July 2014 is a milestone to provide a predictable regulatory environment to enable secure and seamless electronic interactions between businesses, citizens and public authorities.

The eIDAS Regulation:

* ensures that people and businesses can use their own national electronic identification schemes \(eIDs\) to access public services in other EU countries where eIDs are available.
* creates an European internal market for eTS - namely electronic signatures, electronic seals, time stamp, electronic delivery service and website authentication - by ensuring that they will work across borders and have the same legal status as traditional paper based processes. Only by providing certainty on the legal validity of all these services, businesses and citizens will use the digital interactions as their natural way of interaction.
