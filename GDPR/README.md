# Privacy and Data Protection

Norway has some of the worldâ€™s most rigorous privacy and data protection laws that will be further strengthed under the General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\).

# GDPR

The **General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\)** \(Regulation \(EU\) 2016/679\) is a regulation by which the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission intend to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union \(EU\). It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU.

The GDPR aims primarily to give control back to citizens and residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU. When the GDPR takes effect, it will replace the data protection directive \(officially Directive 95/46/EC\) of 1995. The regulation was adopted on 27 April 2016. It becomes enforceable from 25 May 2018 after a two-year transition period and, unlike a directive, it does not require national governments to pass any enabling legislation, and is thus directly binding and applicable.
