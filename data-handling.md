With Idfy you have the opportunity of consuming our services using dedicated instances in Norwegian data centers. This means you are protected by some of the world’s most **rigorous privacy and data protection laws**. Or, if you prefer a different setup, we can provide our services using leading cloud providers such as Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services.

In addition, we use the **industry’s leading hardware security modules** \(HSMs\) to protect transactions, identities, and applications. HSMs excel at **securing cryptographic keys** and provisioning encryption, decryption, authentication, and digital signing services for a wide range of applications.
