The Idfy dashboard enables you to self service your self for many of the tasks that usefully involves contacting support.

Some of the operations that you could do in the dashboard are:

* Create, edit and remove Oauth clients assosiated with your account

* Upload logo image
* Add, edit and remove Webhooks
* Access account logs \(Webhooks, document, identification, failed Oauth attempts\)

All the functionality of our desktop is base upon our open APIs, if you want to build any of this functionality into your own management software no problem.
