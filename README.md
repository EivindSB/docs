## Get started

To use the API you need an account at Idfy. You can get a free test account by signing up through our [onboarding site](https://onboard.idfy.io).

## Dashboard

The Idfy dashboard enables you to self service your self for many of the tasks that usefully involves contacting support.

Some of the operations that you could do in the dashboard are:

* Create, edit and remove Oauth clients assosiated with your account
* Create, edit and remove OpenIDConnect clients assosiated with your account
* Upload logo image
* Add, edit and remove Webhooks
* Access account logs \(Webhooks, document, identification, failed Oauth attempts\)
* Access usaage graphs
* Access invoice details
* Look at identification log

All the functionality of our desktop is base upon our open APIs, if you want to build any of this functionality into your own management software no problem.

It is also easy to grant access to other collegues, the dashboard utilies our OpenID connect endpoint witch enables multiple identification methods such as Github, Google, BankID, NemID etc.
