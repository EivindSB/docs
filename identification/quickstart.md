# Authentication quickstart

Securely identify your customers online, for logging into your applications, verifying age, name and more.

**Step 1:**

First, you need to establish a test account and API credentials. You can get a free API account in Idfy test environments by completing our onboarding form [here](https://onboard.idfy.io), and specifying that you want access to our identification services. You will then receive an e-mail with your API credentials, as well as some more information, test users and code examples.



**Step 2:**

When you have received your API credentials, you can use these to make calls towards the Idfy identification APIs. You can either make pure REST calls towards our APIs \(i.e. make your own HTTP client\), or use one of our pre-built SDKs in your preferred programming language. Check out our [SDKs](https://developer.idfy.io/sdk) and choose the SDK or approach that fits your needs best. One benefit of using an SDK is that you don't have to manage the API authentication and wrapping of HTTP calls yourself.



**Step 3:**

To get quickly started with testing the authentication/identification services, you can start using your preferred SDK and calling the appropriate methods within that given library, or you can for instance make some initial calls using cURL or the API tool Postman \(see more information and download Postman [here](https://www.getpostman.com)\). For the sake of simplicity, we here show some initial calls using Postman, and our "classic" identification API \(i.e. not the OpenID Connect endpoints\). The Postman collection for the APIs can be found on our [SDK site](https://developer.idfy.io/sdk) \(click "Export", then "Postman 1.0" or "Postman 2.0"\). When you have downloaded this JSON file, open Postman and import the file as a collection.
