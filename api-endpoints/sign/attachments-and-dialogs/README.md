# Attachments and dialogs

Sometimes you need the signer to sign multiple documents, or maybe just show them some attachments. That can be acheived!

You can also include dialogs specified for each signer with an info text.

## [Attachments](attachments.md)

Attachments are PDF documents that can be signed, showed to or accepted by the signer.

## [Dialogs](dialogs.md)

Dialogs contains information text that is displayed to the signer before and/or after the signing.
